| **note:** rev A3 has some [minor errata](https://github.com/delan/usb3sun/blob/default/doc/manual.md#errata) related to resetting the adapter, and lacks support for debugging with the sun keyboard interface enabled, but for most people it should still be more than usable. help us move the last few and get **20 USD off!** |

SPARCstations have [a unique serial-like interface](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Sun_keyboard/mouse_interface) for keyboard and mouse input, using a single 8-pin mini-din port. **usb3sun** allows you to use an ordinary USB keyboard and mouse with your SPARCstation!

in addition to the adapter itself, you will also need a male-to-male 8-pin mini-din cable (available as an option or [sold separately](https://www.tindie.com/products/funnycomputer/sun-mini-din-cable-2-metres/)), and your own USB keyboard and mouse (see below for compatibility).

**caution:** these cables are often sold elsewhere as a “mini-din serial cable”, but you **must** check that each pin is connected to the same pin on the other end. some cables, like the apple 590-0552-A, swap pins 1/2 + 3/5 + 6/8, and such cables must not be used.

### testimonials

[europa64](https://linktr.ee/europa64) says:

“Honestly this is such a game changer, it really makes Suns so much more accessible for people who don’t have a hoard of vintage kit or the money to buy a keyboard on eBay. Getting these old machines into the hands of people is honestly one of the best ways to ensure they get preserved and your device really helps with that <3”

### what’s new

**rev B0** allows for debug logging (and the new debug cli) **without disabling the sun keyboard interface**, and fixes some [minor bugs](https://github.com/delan/usb3sun/blob/B0/doc/manual.md#errata) that happen when resetting the adapter.

new in **firmware 2.0**:

- support for **NeXTSTEP** and **Plan 9**, which require the mouse to run at 1200 baud
- configurable **mouse baud rate** — 9600 (default), 4800, 2400, or 1200 baud
- **debug cli** over UART_RX, allowing you to automate keyboard and mouse inputs

as of **firmware 1.5**, usb3sun can now [**reprogram your idprom**](https://funny.computer.daz.cat/sun/nvram-hostid-faq.txt) with just a few keystrokes, making it easier to boot your workstation with a dead nvram battery!

### hardware features

usb3sun includes an **audible buzzer** to emulate the bell and click functions that would normally be included with a Sun keyboard.

usb3sun also emulates the **power key** in two ways:

* **soft power key** (Right Ctrl+P)
    * sends the power key scancodes (30h/B0h)
    * can turn on your workstation (only when usb3sun is powered externally)
* **onboard power button** (below the display)
    * doesn’t send any scancodes
    * can turn on your workstation (even when not powered externally)

usb3sun has an **oled display** that shows:

* led indicators (caps, compose, scroll, num)
* visual buzzer (click, bell)
* the settings menu

usb3sun has an **onboard reset button** in case the firmware gets stuck, and a **0.1″ debug header** (pins available as an option) that allows you to power the adapter externally for flashing or debugging.

### firmware features

usb3sun has **persistent settings** for:

* forcing click mode (no/off/on)
* click duration (5–100 ms)
* mouse baud rate (for NeXTSTEP and Plan 9)
* your hostid
